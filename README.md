Step 5: Create a new List and add the text in the list if not present in the list along with its length.
Step 6: If duplicates are present remove them and sort them based on the length.
Step 7: Open another blank text file and write the sorted list along with its length in the new text file.
Step 8: If there is any exception occured in the program it is handled by the try catch block.

Ques 2:
Step 1: Create a csv file and save some data containing n number of rows in it.
Step 2: Open the csv file .
Step 3: store the data in csv file to the dictionay by using method csv.DictReader(data).
Step 4: Print the output.
Step 5: If there is any exception occured in the program it is handled by the try catch block.

Ques 3:
Step 1: initialize num=2 (as prime number starts from 2)
Step 2: while num is greater than 0 and if num is greater than 1.
Step 3: for i in range (2 to num) goto step 4 else goto step 5.
Step 4: if num % i == 0 then break the loop.
Step 5: print num.
Step 6: for acheiving time interval of 5 seconds function time.sleep(5) is used.
Step 7: num=num+1.
Step 8: If there is any exception occured in the program it is handled by the try catch block.

Ques 4:
Step 1: Input two numbers num1 and num2
Step 2: if num1>num2.
Step 3: smaller=num2 else smaller=num1.
Step 4: for i in range (1 to smaller+1)
Step 5: if(num1%i==0)and(num2%i==0)
Step 6: hcf=i.
Step 7: print hcf.
Step 8: If there is any exception occured in the program it is handled by the try catch block.

Ques 5:
Step 1: Input a decimal number.
Step 2: convert the decimal number to Binary equivalent by using function bin(dec).
Step 3: convert the decimal number to Octal equivalent by using function oct(dec).
Step 4: convert the decimal number to Hexadecimal equivalent by using function hex(dec).
Step 5: print the corresponding biary, octal and hexadecimal output.
Step 6: If there is any exception occured in the program it is handled by the try catch block.

Ques 6:
Step 1: Input a character.
Step 2: print the corresponding ascii value by using the function ord(c).
